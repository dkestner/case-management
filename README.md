# case-management
A system that allows for reports in google docs from google sheets which data is gather from google forms
 Data from the sheet has two rationships to the report:
   1. a one to one relation ship e.g. item[1] is a name {name} resulting in the form merging with the actual name in the form.
   2. it filters out unnecessary information. the google form is a general form determining what needs to be address. the document/report should have the material responses to allow for faster review.
  
  approach:
    1. was to code a mail merge which took care of a goal one.
    2. use multiple sheets to filter out the responses.
